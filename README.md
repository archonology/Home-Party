## Description
A full-stack website built collaboratively. Home Party is a place to invite your family and friends for tracking your favorite homes and all the things you would like to have in it.
    
## Installation
View the deployed site (link above) to view the site without install.  To run it locally, clone the repo and do an `npm install` in the root file of the project.  You can use the test data in the seed file by running `npm run seed`, or skip to `npm start` and add your own data through the front end. The project runs out of the local port `3001`.  

## Usage Info
if you are running localling, you will need to create your own .env file to track your MySql login info.  This app won't work locally without  a .env in the root  folder that looks like this: 
`DB_NAME="dreams_db" DB_USER="root" DB_PASSWORD=""`
